# GDAL
Building GDAL as a *.JAR for android

# How TO...
Clone the project and open it with Android Studio 3.0+
Alternatively the project can be build from command line with gradlew (https://developer.android.com/studio/build/building-cmdline).
A special build type 'install' will compile the actual GDAL and PROJ.4 submodules while the normal debug/release types will compile the .aar.
